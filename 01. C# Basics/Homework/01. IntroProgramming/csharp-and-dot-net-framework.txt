.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Mircrosoft within its .NET initiative and runs primarily on Microsoft Windows.
It includes a large class library known as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability across several programming languages.
FCL includes Base Class Library (BCL), Data Tier (ADO.NET, EF, LINQ and XML),
Communication and Workflow Teir (WCF, WWF), ASP.NET, Windows Forms, WPF/XAML, WinJS/Win8. 
Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment, known as Common Language Runtime (CLR).
Code written in a language compatible with .NET Framework is compiled to the non-platform specific Common Intermediate Language (CIL).
After that the CLR compiles CIL to machine readable code that can be executed on the current platform, implementing features such as Security and Memory management.
FCL and CLR together constitute .NET Framework. Microsoft also produces an integrated development environment largely for .NET software called Visual Studio.

A programming language (like C#) is a formal constructed language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.
C# is a  multi-paradigm programming language developed by Mircosoft designed to work with .NET Framework.

C# and .NET Framework are two related but different things that are both part of the .NET initiative.
