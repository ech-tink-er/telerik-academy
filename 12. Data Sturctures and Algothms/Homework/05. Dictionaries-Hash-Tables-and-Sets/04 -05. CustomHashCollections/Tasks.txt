04. Implement the data structure hash table in a class HashTable<K,T>.
Keep the data in array of lists of key-value pairs (LinkedList<KeyValuePair<K,T>>[]) with initial capacity of 16.
When the hash table load runs over 75%, perform resizing to 2 times larger capacity.
Implement the following methodsand properties:

Add(key, value)
Find(key)->value
Remove(key)
Count
Clear()
this[]
Keys

Try to make the hash table to support iterating over its elements with foreach.
Write unit tests for your class.

05. Implement the data structure set in a class HashedSet<T> using your class HashTable<K,T> to hold the elements.
Implement all standard set operations like

Add(T)
Find(T) <= Should be Contains...
Remove(T)
Count
Clear()
union and
intersect

Write unit tests for your class.
