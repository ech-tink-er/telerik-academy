01. Write a program that counts in a given array of double values the number of occurrences of each value. Use Dictionary<TKey,TValue>.
Example: array = {3, 4, 4, -2.5, 3, 3, 4, 3, -2.5}
-2.5 -> 2 times
3 -> 4 times
4 -> 3 times

02. Write a program that extracts from a given sequence of strings all elements that present in it odd number of times. Example:

{C#, SQL, PHP, PHP, SQL, SQL } -> {C#, SQL}

03. Write a program that counts how many times each word from given text file words.txt appears in it.
The character casing differences should be ignored. The result words should be ordered by their number of occurrences in the text. Example:

This is the TEXT. Text, text, text – THIS TEXT! Is this the text?
is -> 2
the -> 2
this -> 3
text -> 6
