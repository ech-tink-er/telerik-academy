//Problem 1. Strings in C#.
//Describe the strings in C#.
//What is typical for the string data type?
//Describe the most important methods of the String class.


//Strings are sequences of Unicode characters represented by the string data type in C#.
//String is immutable, kept in dynamic memory and is a reference type.
//A string has a fixed length and its characters can be accessed with an index.
//String is also a nullable type.
//Usefull methods for working with strings are:
//CompareTo(), Contains(), IndexOf(), LastIndexOf(), ToUpper(), ToLower(), Insert(), Split(), ToCharArray(), SubString()
//When building strings in loops it's best to use the StringBuilder class. :)
